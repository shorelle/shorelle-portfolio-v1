excerpt: The art portfolio of Desiree Surjadi. I enjoy interpreting stories and am inspired by graphic novels and animation from around the world.

My inspirations are a mix of western and eastern animation and too many graphic novels. I wish recreate, reimagine, and build on the feeling I experienced when first encountering the stories I love.
