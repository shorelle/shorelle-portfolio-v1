Packaging concept development for a boutique soap brand.

<!--more-->
This brief was to design a concept for a (fictitious) organic soap from the Three Brothers region in Japan. San — meaning both "three" and an honorific – combines a modern edge with a sense of its historic background.

There are two variations — 'mountain' and 'river' soap — according to the origin of their natural ingredients for different skin types.
