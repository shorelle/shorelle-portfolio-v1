    title: The typeface - what a good yarn
---

A handmade project to redesign a book cover for the novel <b>Anansi Boys</b> by Neil Gaiman, one of my favourite authors.

The letters and spiderweb are made using crocheted yarn, with the resulting shadows representing the themes of duality and illusions found in story, along with its mythological background.

A typeface was also made for all the letters of the alphabet using the remaining yarn. (There was a lot of yarn!)
