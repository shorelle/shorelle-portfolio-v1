Branding and corporate identity for a new airline branch.

<!--more-->
This airline aims to provide low-cost travel with quality service and style. It required a fresh brand with a sense of glamour to set it apart from other budget airlines and highlight its focus on new technologies, such as booking apps and digital ticketing.

Altair Airlines is a fictional concept named after the [Eagle Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair), and draws from the patterns and colours of space for a forward-thinking, clean look to complement the "Altair alternative" in budget air travel.
