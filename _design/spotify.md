A themed skin for the Spotify website to promote their <b>Summer of Music</b> campaign, featuring a different genre of music every week.

<!--more-->
This theme was inspired by the hard, retro-futuristic and gritty atmosphere of the genre of industrial rock, with a throwback to the heyday of the '90s and '00s

The typeface developed for this theme would be used for other promotional materials, including flyers and CD samplers (for that additional sense of nostalgia...)
