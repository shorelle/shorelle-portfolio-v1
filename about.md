<p>Hello there! I’m Desiree Surjadi, a human who writes code, designs things and makes art (in between dancing badly in front of my cats).</p>

<p>I’m passionate about: the wondrous mess of art, stories and technology that broadens and deepens our connection with this bizarre world, and the inimitable lifeforms in it.</p>

<p>In my past lives I have worked as a consulting engineer on sustainable technologies and energy efficiency, before moving to digital design, branding and web development projects for a range of clients including UNICEF, Greenpeace, WWF, Amnesty International, Cancer Council Australia and the Australian Conservation Foundation. I'm currently making things at <a href="https://www.canva.com" target="_blank">Canva</a> <i class="fa fa-heart-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

<p>Drop me a line if you would like to get in touch, for work or to collaborate on a project!</p>
