<p>Hello! I'm Desiree, a webdesigner/developer and illustrator from Sydney, currently making things at <a href="https://www.canva.com" target="_blank">Canva</a> <i class="fa fa-heart-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

<p>I'm passionate about using technology and visual art to broaden our understanding of the world and sense of wonder with the universe, and to help each other connect with the people in it. I also love space operas and the smell of coffee.</p>

<p>Drop me a line if you would like to get in touch, for work or to collaborate on a project!</p>
